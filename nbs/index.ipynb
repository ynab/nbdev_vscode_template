    "And VSCode is a good notebook environment because you get [CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/), debugging, and other things that we are used to.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Editing the README\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To get started, open VSCode in this folder: `code .`\n",
    "2. When prompted, install the workspace suggested extensions (like Python, Jupyter, etc)\n",
    "3. Then, open the `nbs/index.ipynb` file in VSCode.\n",
    "4. VSCode might likely prompt you to install Jupyter. That's cool.\n",
    "5. Edit the index.ipynb file, and watch as it automatically becomes your README.md when you run `nbdev_build_docs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To keep your docs updated as you edit your notebooks, run:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "    $ ./scripts/nbdev_preview.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Editing the libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "The other notebooks automatically get converted to .py files when you run `nbdev_build_lib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To see how that works, open `00_core.ipynb`.\n",
    "2. run `nbdev_build_lib` to convert it to a .py file.\n",
    "3. Open the `nbdev_in_vscode_template/core.py` file that was generated.\n",
    "4. Put your cursor in the `say_hello` function and press F12 to jump to the definition of that function in your 00_core.ipynb file. (This is feature of the [nbdev-vscode extension](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev-vscode).)\n",
    "5. Put your cursor in the `add_one` function in the notebook and hit `F12` and see it jump to your function definition in the .py file.\n"

    "## Committing changes to git\n",
    "This repository uses pre-commit hooks to cleanup the notebook before pushing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: The simplest way to do things is to run this script to ensure that things are ready to be committed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "    ./scripts/nbdev_prepare.sh\n",
    "    # Now git commit as always\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Rely upon pre-commit hooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you do a git commit in this repo that has pre-commit hooks installed, your new workflow will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. pre-commit runs each hook on your staged changes (as in, changes that you git added)\n",
    "2. If a hook changes files – for example, if a commited notebook wasn’t cleaned – pre-commit stops the commit, leaving those changes as unstaged. (This won't happen if you use nbdev_prepare!)\n",
    "3. You can now stage those changes and make any edits required to get pre-commit to pass\n",
    "4. Redo the git commit, and if it succeeds, your commit will be created.\n",
    "5. Using it in practice isn’t as complicated as it might sound. The best way to figure out if it works for you is to give it a try.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have questions, see [this documentation about nbdev pre_commit](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/pre_commit.html) \n",
